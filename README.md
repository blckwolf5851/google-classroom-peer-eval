# A Peer Evaluation Feature Extension to Google Classroom
Build collaborative online environment with the additional feature.

This extension works well with the additional feature for Hypatia Desktop built, can be found in this repo (https://github.com/blckwolf5851/hypatia-peer-eval)

## How to use the extension
Go to the all submission page of an assignment (where majority of the student turned in their work)

Click the extension button, and it will by default select all students to distribute. You could deselect students so their work will not be distributed and they will not be receiving peer's submission.

Once everything is configured correctly, press "Redistribute Assignment" button to distribute submission among students.

You will see the invitation to peer review appear in the private comment box for each student, this gives you a chance to make final changes to the invitation before sending them to students. Go on and send these once you are comfortable with the arrangements.
